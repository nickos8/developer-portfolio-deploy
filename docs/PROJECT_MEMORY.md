> Future assistant: read `AGENTS.md` and every document it references before changing the project. Inspect the working tree and tests because GitHub cannot contain uncommitted local work. Never document secrets.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01  
**Repository:** `nickos8/developer-portfolio`  
**Default branch:** `main`  
**Latest verified code commit:** `a26b3e5` — **Add admin authentication and protected project creation**  
**Current phase:** Authenticated Projects CRUD; create operation and session authentication complete  
**Next exact feature:** Design and implement the authenticated project-management interface in React, beginning with a project creation form that displays Laravel validation errors  
**Working tree at checkpoint:** Local `main` clean and synchronized with `origin/main`

## 1. Purpose

Build a professional full-stack developer portfolio that demonstrates the owner's junior web development skills:

- PHP and Laravel backend development
- React and JavaScript frontend development
- PostgreSQL database design
- REST-style JSON APIs
- CRUD, validation, authentication, and authorization
- automated and manual testing
- Git and GitHub workflow
- technical documentation and independent explanation

Visitors should be able to view published projects. The authenticated administrator should be able to create, update, publish, feature, reorder, and delete projects.

The project is also a learning environment. Follow the teaching contract in `AGENTS.md`.

## 2. Technology and environment

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 with Vite 8 | SPA interface, state, forms, API requests |
| HTTP client | Axios | Shared credentials and XSRF-aware request configuration |
| Backend | Laravel 13 | Routes, validation, authentication, business logic, JSON |
| Authentication | Laravel Sanctum 4.3 | First-party SPA session authentication |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL | Persistent application data |
| Tests | PHPUnit/Laravel with SQLite `:memory:` | Isolated backend verification |
| Version control | Git and GitHub | History, backup, review, handoff |

Repository:

├── frontend/
└── docs/
    ├── PROJECT_MEMORY.md
    ├── LEARNING_LOG.md

```

Windows paths:

```text
C:\Users\Niko\developer-portfolio
C:\Users\Niko\developer-portfolio\backend
C:\Users\Niko\developer-portfolio\frontend
```

Use Herd:

```cmd
herd php
herd composer
```

Plain PHP and Composer may use XAMPP PHP 8.2, which is incompatible with Laravel 13. The verified Herd PHP version is 8.4.24.

## 3. Published checkpoints

### Initialization

- `394e356` — Initialize Laravel 13 and React portfolio project
- Created separate `backend/` and `frontend/` applications
- Initialized Git and confirmed ignores

### Supabase connection

- `15d0a8e` — Configure Supabase PostgreSQL connection
- Connected through the Supabase Session pooler
- Required SSL
- Used a dedicated `laravel` schema
- Kept real environment values out of Git
- Ran and verified Laravel default migrations

### Project database layer

- `2607a9f` — Add Project model and database migration
- Added Project model, fillable fields, and casts
- Created and migrated the projects table
- Verified the unique slug index and table columns

### Public Projects API

- `27318f1` — Add public Projects API endpoint
- Enabled API routing
- Installed Sanctum for later authentication
- Added public `GET /api/projects`
- Filtered to published records
- Ordered by display order
- Manually verified the JSON response

### Project-memory publication

- `5497148` — Mark public Projects API as published
- Recorded the first API checkpoint and safe continuation state

### Authentication and protected project creation

- `a26b3e5` — Add admin authentication and protected project creation
- Added project validation and creation
- Added unique slug generation
- Added Sanctum stateful SPA configuration
- Added login, current-user, and logout behavior
- Added exact credentialed CORS configuration
- Added an environment-backed administrator seeder
- Added the shared Axios client
- Added React login, session restoration, and logout
- Added authentication and project API feature tests
- Verified backend and frontend checks
- Published to `origin/main`

## 4. Projects table

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` | Primary identifier |
| `title` | Display name |
| `slug` | Unique URL-friendly identifier |
| `short_description` | Project-card summary, maximum 300 |
| `description` | Full description |
| `tech_stack` | JSON technology list |
| `github_url` | Optional repository URL |
| `live_url` | Optional deployed URL |
| `image_path` | Optional image location |
| `is_featured` | Featured placement flag |
| `is_published` | Public visibility flag |
| `display_order` | Manual ordering |
| timestamps | Created and updated times |

Model casts:

- `tech_stack` → array
- `is_featured` → boolean
- `is_published` → boolean
- `display_order` → integer

## 5. Current backend behavior

### Public project listing

```text
GET /api/projects
→ ProjectController@index
→ where is_published = true
→ order by display_order
→ JSON collection
```

The endpoint is public. An empty array means the query succeeded but no published projects matched.

### Protected project creation

```text
POST /api/projects
→ auth:sanctum
→ StoreProjectRequest authorization
→ validation
→ unique slug loop
→ Project::create
→ 201 JSON response
```

Validation includes:

- required title, short description, description, and technology list
- per-item technology validation
- nullable valid GitHub and live URLs
- optional booleans for featured and published
- optional non-negative integer display order

Slug example:

```text
Portfolio System → portfolio-system
duplicate → portfolio-system-2
next duplicate → portfolio-system-3
```

### Remaining project controller actions

- `show`: not implemented
- `update`: not implemented
- `destroy`: not implemented
- image upload: not implemented

## 6. Authentication architecture

This is a first-party SPA using Laravel session cookies recognized by Sanctum.

### Middleware

`bootstrap/app.php` enables:

```php
$middleware->statefulApi();
```

This allows stateful SPA requests. It does not log in a user.

### Web authentication routes

- `POST /login`
- `POST /logout`, protected by `auth`

Login:

1. `LoginRequest` validates email and password.
2. `Auth::attempt` checks the credentials.
3. Incorrect credentials return a validation error.
4. The session is regenerated.
5. JSON returns the authenticated user.

Logout:

1. logs out the web guard
2. invalidates the session
3. regenerates the CSRF token
4. returns `204 No Content`

### Protected current-user endpoint

- `GET /api/user`
- protected by `auth:sanctum`
- returns the current authenticated user

### CORS and environment

`config/cors.php` covers API, login, logout, and Sanctum CSRF paths, allows the configured frontend origin, and supports credentials.

Safe placeholders are in `backend/.env.example`:

- `ADMIN_NAME`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `FRONTEND_URL`

Real values remain only in ignored `backend/.env`.

### Administrator seeder

`AdminUserSeeder`:

1. reads `config('admin')`
2. validates the three values
3. uses `User::updateOrCreate` by email
4. relies on the User model's hashed password cast

The seeder was run successfully and Tinker confirmed the configured administrator exists.

## 7. Current React behavior

### Shared API client

`frontend/src/api.js` configures:

- base URL from `VITE_API_URL`, falling back to local Laravel
- `withCredentials: true`
- `withXSRFToken: true`
- JSON acceptance

Axios is declared in `package.json` and locked in `package-lock.json`.

### Login

```text
GET /sanctum/csrf-cookie
→ POST /login
→ GET /api/user
→ set React user state
```

Wrong credentials display the backend error. Correct credentials display the administrator welcome state.

### Session restoration

On initial render, `useEffect` requests `/api/user` while the interface shows a session-checking state.

- valid session → restore React user state
- missing or invalid session → show login form

This prevents a refresh from losing the authenticated interface while the Laravel session is still valid.

### Logout

The React interface posts to `/logout`, clears its local user state, and returns to the login form. Refreshing after logout remains logged out.

### Next frontend work

The current `App.jsx` is an authentication proof-of-flow, not the final portfolio design.

Next:

1. authenticated project creation form
2. controlled inputs for every validated field
3. dynamic technology list or a clear initial input strategy
4. submit through the shared API client
5. display Laravel `422` field errors
6. show successful creation response
7. refetch or update the project list
8. separate components as the interface grows

## 8. Verification evidence

### Manual browser and HTTP checks

Verified:

- wrong login credentials are rejected
- correct login displays the administrator
- `/api/user` returns `401` without an authenticated session
- authenticated session is recognized
- refresh restores the user
- logout works
- refresh after logout remains logged out
- credentialed CORS returns the exact React origin and allows credentials
- unauthenticated project creation returns `401`

### Backend tests

Latest complete result at commit `a26b3e5`:

```text
Tests: 10 passed (34 assertions)
Duration: 1.11s
```

Authentication tests:

- guest cannot access current-user endpoint
- user can login and access it
- incorrect credentials are rejected
- authenticated user can logout

Project API tests:

- guest cannot create a project
- authenticated session can create a project
- duplicate title receives a unique slug
- invalid data is rejected

The project tests use `$this->actingAs($user)` because the real application uses session authentication. The earlier `Sanctum::actingAs` attempt failed with missing `withAccessToken()` because it simulated token authentication.

`backend/phpunit.xml` uses:

```text
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=:memory:
```

Tests do not modify Supabase.

### Frontend

Latest results:

```text
npm run lint
Found 0 warnings and 0 errors.

npm run build
Vite production build completed successfully.
```

### Git checks

- `git diff --check` produced only Windows LF/CRLF warnings, no whitespace errors
- exact intended files were staged
- real `.env` was not staged
- commit `a26b3e5` pushed successfully
- local `main` confirmed clean and synchronized with `origin/main`

## 10. Exact resume procedure

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and all linked documentation.
2. From the project root:

```cmd
git status --short --untracked-files=all
git log --oneline --decorate -10
git fetch origin
git status -sb
```

3. If the tree is clean and documentation changes have been merged remotely, synchronize with:

```cmd
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

4. Re-run verification if the environment or code has changed:

```cmd
cd backend
herd php artisan test
cd ..\frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

5. Begin the React project-creation form by first inspecting:
   - `frontend/src/App.jsx`
   - `frontend/src/api.js`
   - `backend/app/Http/Requests/StoreProjectRequest.php`
   - `backend/routes/api.php`

6. Teach controlled form state and backend validation-error mapping before implementing the complete form.
